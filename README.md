# Crypto Transaction Visualizer
This visualizer is a more intuitive way to visualize activity on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) blockchain.

Through this project, I hope to gain more experience with graphs, creating a GUI, and using an API.

# Current Functionality
Data can be pulled from [BscScan](https://bscscan.com), utilizing the API.

# Future Functionality
A user interface where a wallet address can be entered and then a digraph is generated with the wallets as nodes and where the directed edges show the net direction that capital is flowing. Thicker edges represent more transactions between wallets, greener edges represent more capital moved between wallets.
